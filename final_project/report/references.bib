abstract = {We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo scheme which allows efficient calculations of the Green function at finite temperature and the study of large disordered systems. The scheme is ergodic, works with non-zero winding numbers and in the grand canonical ensemble. The central idea is using a pair of worldline discontinuities for sampling the extended configuration space of the system which includes both closed and disconnected worldlines. The method is illustrated by simulations of pure and disordered bosonic Hubbard models in 1D.}

  abstract  = "Some simplifications of the integrals (2n+1), derived by Wu et
               al (1976 13 316), that contribute to the zero field
               susceptibility of the 2D square lattice Ising model are
               reported. In particular, several alternate expressions for the
               integrands in (2n+1) are determined which greatly facilitate
               both the generation of high-temperature series and analytical
               analysis. One can show that as series, (2n+1) =
               22n(s/2)4n(n+1)(1+O(s)) where s is the high-temperature variable
               sin(2K) with K the conventional normalized inverse temperature.
               Analysis of the integrals near symmetry points of the integrands
               shows that (2n+1)(s) is singular on the unit circle at sk =
               exp(ik) where 2cos(k) = cos(2 k/(2n+1))+cos(2/(2n+1)), -n k, n.
               The singularities, k = 0 excepted, are logarithmic branch points
               of order 2n(n+1)-1ln() with = 1-s/sk. There is numerical
               evidence from series that these van Hove points, in addition to
               the known points at s = ?1 and ?i, exhaust the singularities on
               the unit circle. Barring cancellation from extra (unobserved)
               singularities one can conclude that |s| = 1 is a natural
               boundary for the susceptibility.",
